# Brita

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/procore/brita.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/procore/brita)

A tool to build your own filters and sorts with Rails and Active Record!

## Developer Usage
Include Brita in your controllers, and define some filters.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  include Brita

  filter_on :title, type: :string

  def index
    render json: filtrate(Post.all)
  end
end
```

This will allow users to pass `?filters[title]=foo` and get the `Post`s with the title `foo`.

Brita will also handle rendering errors using the standard rails errors structure. You can add this to your controller by adding,

```ruby
before_action :render_filter_errors, unless: :filters_valid?

def render_filter_errors
  render json: { errors: filter_errors } and return
end
```

to your controller.

These errors are based on the type that you told brita your param was.

### Filter Types
Every filter must have a type, so that Brita knows what to do with it. The current valid filter types are:
* int - Filter on an integer column
* decimal - Filter on a decimal column
* boolean - Filter on a boolean column
* string - Filter on a string column
* text - Filter on a text column
* date - Filter on a date column
* time - Filter on a time column
* datetime - Filter on a datetime column
* scope - Filter on an ActiveRecord scope

### Filter on Scopes
Just as your filter values are used to scope queries on a column, values you
pass to a scope filter will be used as arguments to that scope. For example:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :with_body, ->(text) { where(body: text) }
end

class PostsController < ApplicationController
  include Brita

  filter_on :with_body, type: :scope

  def index
    render json: filtrate(Post.all)
  end
end
```

Passing `?filters[with_body]=my_text` will call the `with_body` scope with
`my_text` as the argument.

Scopes that accept no arguments are currently not supported.

#### Accessing Params with Filter Scopes

Filters with `type: :scope` have access to the params hash by passing in the desired keys to the `scope_params`. The keys passed in will be returned as a hash with their associated values, and should always appear as the last argument in your scope.

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :user_posts_on_date, ->(date, options) {
    where(user_id: options[:user_id], blog_id: options[:blog_id], date: date)
  }
end

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  include Brita

  filter_on :user_posts_on_date, type: :scope, scope_params: [:user_id, :blog_id]

  def show
    render json: filtrate(Post.all)
  end
end
```
Passing `?filters[user_posts_on_date]=10/12/20` will call the `user_posts_on_date` scope with
`10/12/20` as the the first argument, and will grab the `user_id` and `blog_id` out of the params and pass them as a hash, as the second argument.

### Renaming Filter Params

A filter param can have a different field name than the column or scope. Use `internal_name` with the correct name of the column or scope.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  include Brita

  filter_on :post_id, type: :int, internal_name: :id

end
```

### Filter on Ranges
Some parameter types support ranges. Ranges are expected to be a string with the bounding values separated by `...`

For example `?filters[price]=3...50` would return records with a price between 3 and 50.

The following types support ranges
* int
* decimal
* boolean
* date
* time
* datetime

### Filter on JSON Array
`int` type filters support sending the values as an array in the URL Query parameters. For example `?filters[id]=[1,2]`. This is a way to keep payloads smaller for GET requests. When URI encoded this will become `filters%5Bid%5D=%5B1,2%5D` which is much smaller the standard format of `filters%5Bid%5D%5B%5D=1&&filters%5Bid%5D%5B%5D=2`.

On the server side, the params will be received as:
```ruby
# JSON array encoded result
"filters"=>{"id"=>"[1,2]"}

# standard array format
"filters"=>{"id"=>["1", "2"]}
```

Note that this feature cannot currently be wrapped in an array and should not be used in combination with sending array parameters individually.
 * `?filters[id][]=[1,2]` => invalid
 * `?filters[id][]=[1,2]&filters[id][]=3` => invalid
 * `?filters[id]=[1,2]&filters[id]=3` => valid but only 3 is passed through to the server
 * `?filters[id]=[1,2]` => valid

#### A note on encoding for JSON Array feature
JSON arrays contain the reserved characters "`,`" and "`[`" and "`]`". When encoding a JSON array in the URL there are two different ways to handle the encoding. Both ways are supported by Rails.
For example, lets look at the following filter with a JSON array `?filters[id]=[1,2]`:
 * `?filters%5Bid%5D=%5B1,2%5D`
 * `?filters%5Bid%5D%3D%5B1%2C2%5D`

In both cases Rails will correctly decode to the expected result of
```ruby
{ "filters" => { "id" => "[1,2]" } }
```

### Sort Types
Every sort must have a type, so that Brita knows what to do with it. The current valid sort types are:
* int - Sort on an integer column
* decimal - Sort on a decimal column
* string - Sort on a string column
* text - Sort on a text column
* date - Sort on a date column
* time - Sort on a time column
* datetime - Sort on a datetime column
* scope - Sort on an ActiveRecord scope

### Sort on Scopes
Just as your sort values are used to scope queries on a column, values you
pass to a scope sort will be used as arguments to that scope. For example:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :order_on_body_no_params, -> { order(body: :asc) }
  scope :order_on_body, ->(direction) { order(body: direction) }
  scope :order_on_body_then_id, ->(body_direction, id_direction) { order(body: body_direction).order(id: id_direction) }
end

class PostsController < ApplicationController
  include Brita

  sort_on :order_by_body_ascending, internal_name: :order_on_body_no_params, type: :scope
  sort_on :order_by_body, internal_name: :order_on_body, type: :scope, scope_params: [:direction]
  sort_on :order_by_body_then_id, internal_name: :order_on_body_then_id, type: :scope, scope_params: [:direction, :asc]


  def index
    render json: filtrate(Post.all)
  end
end
```

`scope_params` takes an order-specific array of the scope's arguments. Passing in the param :direction allows the consumer to choose which direction to sort in (ex. `-order_by_body` will sort `:desc` while `order_by_body` will sort `:asc`)

Passing `?sort=-order_by_body` will call the `order_on_body` scope with
`:desc` as the argument. The direction is the only argument that the consumer has control over.
Passing `?sort=-order_by_body_then_id` will call the `order_on_body_then_id` scope where the `body_direction` is `:desc`, and the `id_direction` is `:asc`. Note: in this example the user has no control over id_direction. To demonstrate:
Passing `?sort=order_by_body_then_id` will call the `order_on_body_then_id` scope where the `body_direction` this time is `:asc`, but the `id_direction` remains `:asc`.

Scopes that accept no arguments are currently supported, but you should note that the user has no say in which direction it will sort on.

`scope_params` can also accept symbols that are keys in the `params` hash. The value will be fetched and passed on as an argument to the scope.

### Filtering Non Active Record Collections
Currently there is basic support for filtering arrays that are passed into `filtrate(..)` instead of an Active Record collection.

#### Usage
Use an array in place of the result of your active record query.
  ```ruby
  # active record
  filtrate(Post.all)
  
  # array
  filtrate([{ id: 1, title: "One"}, {id: 2, title: "Two" }])
  ```

#### Supported Array Filter Types
* int - Sort on an integer column
* decimal - Sort on a decimal column
* string - Sort on a string column
* text - Sort on a text column

### Sorting on Non Active Record Collections
This feature is not currently supported.  Brita will not error if you attempt to sort on an array, and will return the original collection without sorting applied.

## Consumer Usage

Filter:
`?filters[<field_name>]=<value>`

Filters are translated to Active Record `where`s and are chained together. The order they are applied is not guarenteed.

Sort:
`?sort=-published_at,position`

Sort is translated to Active Record `order` The sorts are applied in the order they are passed by the client.
the `-` symbol means to sort in `desc` order. By default, keys are sorted in `asc` order.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brita'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install brita
```

## Without Rails

We have some future plans to remove the rails dependency so that other frameworks such as Sinatra could leverage this gem.

## Contributing
